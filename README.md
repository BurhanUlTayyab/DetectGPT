# DetectGPT
Pytorch implementation of DetectGPT https://arxiv.org/pdf/2301.11305v1.pdf

## Introduction
DetectGPT is an amazing method to determine whether a piece of text is written by large language models (like ChatGPT, GPT3, GPT2, BLOOM etc). However, we couldn't find any open-source implementation of it. Therefore this is the implementation of the paper.
